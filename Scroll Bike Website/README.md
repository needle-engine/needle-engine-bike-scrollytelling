## Get started

Run the template locally and run `npm i` and then `npm start`.   

To modify the animation or 3D scene open the Unity project in `needle-engine-bike-unity` (parent directory) that comes with this repository. In Unity you can click `Play` (you may need to login to your Needle Account if it's the first time) and the local server with this web project should start. You can then continue editing the animations or any of the content and see you website update when you save the Unity scene.

## Content

- `index.html` - Contains a content and page setup. Add or edit content to your liking
- `src/style.css` - The CSS styles for the website
- `src/main.ts` - Here we add some basic javascript to make scrolling smoother or to fade-in and -out the scroll sections when they enter the screen.
